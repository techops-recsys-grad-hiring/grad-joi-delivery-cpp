# Welcome to JOI Delivery
JOI Delivery is built for real life. For the young professional who gets home late and doesn’t have the energy to cook. For the student with an exam tomorrow and an empty fridge tonight. These aren’t exceptions — they’re everyday moments. That’s why JOI Delivery brings food and groceries to your door, fast, fresh, and right when you need them.

Customers struggle with:

- Cluttered browsing experiences that don’t understand their preferences.
- Limited customization when ordering meals or groceries.
- Unclear order status or delivery timelines.
- Poor payment experience, or failed checkouts.
- Lack of timely feedback channels to report a bad experience or appreciate a good one.

JOI Delivery was built not just as another delivery app, but as a thoughtful, technology-first platform that reimagines how essentials reach customers in the most seamless way.

# Introducing JOI Delivery

## Tech Requirements
The project makes use of Conan to help you out carrying some common tasks such as building the project or running it.
Technically, Conan is not must have, but in order to simplify environment setup, following guideline is based on Conan.

1. CMake 3.23 above is **required**.

Check [here](https://cmake.org/download/) for installation if you get a older version.

2. Conan 2.0 above is **required**.

Check [here](https://docs.conan.io/2/installation.html) for installation if you get a older version.

### Build the project

1. Setup a profile for **Conan**, if this is the first time you get Conan 2.x run on your machine.

```shell
conan profile detect
```

Now, assuming you are already at the root of this repository, follow:

2. Install or build the dependencies


```shell
conan install . --output-folder=build -s build_type=Debug --build=missing
```

3. Generate build system for this repository

```shell
cmake --preset conan-debug
```

> ☀️ If you are building on **Windows with Visual Studio** (Generator), please use `conan-default` instead of, like:
>
> ```shell
> cmake --preset conan-default
> ```

4. **Build this repository**
```shell
cmake --build build
```

*Note:* ☀️ If you are building on **Windows with Visual Studio** (Generator), and prefer IDE, you could find a generate project file in `build` directory and open it with Visual Studio for building and test running.
> ⚡️With option `-j<number>` (e.g. -j4 ) could enable parallel build job, which could usually accelerate your build.

### Run the tests

Unit tests can be executed as follows.

- Run unit tests.

  ```shell
  cd build/
  ctest .
  ```

- Opitonally, Use `--verbose` flag with ctest for detailed test results.

```shell
  cd build/
  ctest . --verbose
  ```
